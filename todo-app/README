How Everything Connects (Big Picture)

User calls API → e.g. POST /api/todos with JSON.

Controller (TodoController) receives it → converts JSON → Todo object.

Service (TodoService) contains business logic → decides how to save/update/delete.

Repository (TodoRepository) interacts with Database (H2) via JPA.

Entity (Todo) defines table structure in DB.

Spring Boot wires everything automatically (thanks to @SpringBootApplication, @Autowired/constructor injection, etc).
